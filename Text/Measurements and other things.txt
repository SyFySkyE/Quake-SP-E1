Should I stick to a rule of the paths leading to the main areas shoudl be larger than the paths leading to minor points?
	- At this point (3/11) worried this rule would make things too simple. Might be itneresting having large paths w/ other ones that are chokepoints

also update 2d map, manifesto and journal with David's comments

not really about specific lg and small areas. Doesn't have to be exact ie sm map isn't just 608 units

it's really not about being complex. It's about making sense, but still giving little suprises.

Don't focus too many on "this path should be small, lrg, etc." during initial planning. Have a number of each you'd like to use, figure out the best
Place to use them during production

make it easy to rocket jump out
focal point with two paths two narrow?
