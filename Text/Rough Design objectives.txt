- Use gimmicks such as side strafing, rocket jumping, electro in water.
- Should be hard to get special powerups, easy to get others.
- Spawns should be facing open areas, clear to where to go next. Maybe weapons close to spawn.
- Make bubble chart! Areas should be somewhat modular.
- Don't forget that teleports count as an entry/exit.
- Asymmetry is important, except when it makes sense to use symmetry.
- Contrast is extremely important.
	- Mix of small, claustrophobic areas and large open areas.
		- Say several small areas and one or two large ones?
	- Cieling height.
	- Environments. (Indoor, outdoor, can see outddor)
- Maybe play with areas of narrow staircases with no gaurd on side, can be shot at.
- Maybe play with area of small, narrow lines to cross over for a powerup (can jump for a shortcut), open to everyone else to be shot at.
- Maybe a maze area, fall into combat?
- I want to hjave most, if not all weapons.
	- 6 weapons
- Same with powerups
	- 10 (I'd settle with osmething like 6 or 7)
- Overhangs, verticaility. (no mroe than 3 levels at a time)
- When going down routes, player shuld see sliver of what focal point they're going to
- Figure eights, circles/oval flows running into each other.
- 7 or 8 focal points. 1 or 2 major ones.
